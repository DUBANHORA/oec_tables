Open Exoplanet Catalogue Tables
==============

This repository contains simple ASCII tables that are generated from the [The Open Exoplanet Catalogue](https://github.com/hannorein/open_exoplanet_catalogue). The Open Exoplanet Catalogue is a database of all discovered extra-solar planets. New planets are usually added within 24 hours of their announcement.

Note that many planetary systems are in binary star systems. The architecture of these systems is correctly represented in the original XML files of the Open Exoplanet Catalogue. However, representing these systems in simple ASCII tables as done in this repository is non-trivial and some information is lost. You are encouraged to use the original Open Exoplanet Catalogue instead of these files here.

The database is licensed under an MIT license (see below), which basically says you can do everything with it. If you use it for a scientific publication, please include a reference to the Open Exoplanet Catalogue on [github](https://github.com/hannorein/open_exoplanet_catalogue) or to [this arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.7121).  

The catalogue is maintained by Hanno Rein, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. However, I hope this will become a community project. Please send corrections and additions via pull request or [email](mailto:exoplanet@hanno-rein.de). If you have questions or comments about git or the database, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.
